Connect Four Game

This project implements a Connect Four game using Python programming language and Pygame library.
Features

    Gameplay: Players take turns dropping colored discs into a grid. The first player to connect four discs of the same color vertically, horizontally, or diagonally wins the game.

    Graphical User Interface (GUI): The game provides a user-friendly graphical interface where players can interact with the game board using the mouse.

    File Handling: Player moves are recorded in a file named moves.txt, and the current state of the board is saved in a file named board_state.txt.

    Winning Detection: The game detects when a player has won and displays a message announcing the winner.
